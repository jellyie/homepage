                Taylor is a 24 year old freelance illustrator, and small craft

                storefront. Taylor traditionally sells her small handmade
                ceramic homeware at local pop-up markets, and she has been
                receiving requests on her Instagram page from fans across the

                Taylor, like other small craft business owners, lacks the
                support that larger businesses have when it comes to sourcing
                sustainable materials. This is a multifold issue because she
                also lacks the resources to learn about which sustainable
                materials best fit her needs and besides, sheâ€™s running a
                one-woman show. Who has time to do that?

                I worked with my team in a brainstorming session where we

                discussion. The session was guided by our research findings and
                a task analysis of the order fulfillment process.

                Once we gathered feedback on the concept, we decided to move

                Through conducting user research, I found that most craft
                business owners struggled to find time for researching the best
                sustainable options for their business. To address this issue, I
                incorporated a quiz that matches craft business owners to the
                materials that best fits their needs while providing them an
                option to compare their matches.

                Initially, the first iteration of our design did not allow users
                to compare their options. This was a feature added later on
                after conducting several feedback sessions where participants
                told us that they loved the matching system, but regrettably
                wished that there was a way to compare and even mix + match
                components of each match. I learned that my users highly-valued
                the power of choice!

              <Text variant='body'>
                Once users are matched to a set of materials, they are presented
                with a 3D model of their materials. This gives them the chance
                to interact with the material and learn more about what makes it
                sustainable and why it&apos;s better than its traditional
                counterpart.

                Craft business owners want to feel confident in the
                sustainability choices they make, which translates into being
                able to validate their decisions with facts and research. But
                more importantly, they also strive for the most affordable
                options without sacrificing the visual aesthetics of their
                brand.
